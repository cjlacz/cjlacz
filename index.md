I tend to jump around hobbies a lot and I'll probably talk about mostly one here. I am a cat dad and do some rescue where I am locally.

I think this blog will mainly be about my adventures in home automation and setting up a homelab. I never really expected to have one given the apartments and no real place to isolate noisy equipment, but here I am.  I have to say I'm excited to get my hands on some hardware again.
